# LYRICS CLASSIFIER

This project classifies songs from two artists by identifying which lyrics are more likely to belong to which artist.

A class is defined to scrape the lyrics for both artists using BeautifulSoup.

A MultinomialNB is used to predict the likelihood of a lyric to the artist.

Besides, a NMF is used as decomposition matrix algorithms for topic extraction
